BrainTrust
===
A collection of voice assistants for your desktop.

Braintrust is built on top of [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) and leverages node modules and web technologies to provide intelligent voice commands for Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux.

### CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS

This project is in active development. The hope is that once the platform is complete, developers will be able to easily create and publish their own voice assistant modules which all BrainTrust users can install and use.
